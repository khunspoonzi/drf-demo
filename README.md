# DRF Demo

DRF Demo is a [Django REST Framework](https://github.com/encode/django-rest-framework) project reference for a [City](./location/models.py), [Country](./location/models.py), and [Currency](./currency/models.py) fixture API.

The codebase associated with this project provides a comprehensive implementation of the following features:

- **Heroku**-compatible environment and **dependency management** using the [Pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) library -- See [Pipfile](./Pipfile) | [Pipfile.lock](./Pipfile.lock).

- **Environment-specific project settings** with a `.env` file and the [Python Decouple](https://github.com/henriquebastos/python-decouple/) library -- See [settings.py](./config/settings.py) | [.env](./.env.example)

- **Custom User model** that uses an email address instead of a username -- See [settings.py](./config/settings.py) | [user.models.py](./user/models.py)

- **Manual fixture migrations** for initial database population -- See [populate_locations.py](./location/migrations/0002_populate_locations.py) | [populate_currencies.py](./currency/migrations/0002_populate_currencies.py)

- **PostgreSQL** database configuration settings in conjunction with the [psycopg2](https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg2) database adapter -- See [settings.py](./config/settings.py)

- **Amazon AWS S3**-compatible static and media **file hosting** configuration settings in conjunction with the [boto3](https://github.com/boto/boto3) and [django storages](https://github.com/jschneier/django-storages) libraries -- See [settings.py](./config/settings.py) | [storages.py](./config/storages.py)

- **Celery** and **Redis**-compatible project settings for **scheduled and background tasks** in conjunction with [Celery](https://github.com/celery/celery) and [redis-py](https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py) -- See [settings.py](./config/settings.py) | [celery.py](./config/celery.py) | [Procfile](./Procfile) | [currency.tasks.py](./currency/tasks.py)

## Live Demo

The [live demo](https://drf-demo-backend-production.herokuapp.com/api/) of this project is hosted on a Heroku free tier pipeline and may take up to 30 seconds to wake up.

### Endpoints

For convenience, the Django REST Framework browsable API feature has been enabled so that you can easily navigate through the following publicly available endpoints:

<div align="center">

| Endpoint                                                                                                                       | Description                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| [api / cities /](https://drf-demo-backend-production.herokuapp.com/api/cities)                                                 | All 2,174 cities in database              |
| [api / countries /](https://drf-demo-backend-production.herokuapp.com/api/countries)                                           | All 250 countries in database             |
| [api / countries / :id / cities / (:id) /](https://drf-demo-backend-production.herokuapp.com/api/countries/237/cities)         | All cities that belong to a given country |
| [api / currencies /](https://drf-demo-backend-production.herokuapp.com/api/currencies)                                         | All 114 currencies in database            |
| [api / currencies / :id / countries / (:id) /](https://drf-demo-backend-production.herokuapp.com/api/currencies/106/countries) | All countries that use a given currency   |

</div>

Note that the country and currency endpoints accept ID lookups as well as field lookups.

The country endpoint accepts ID, ISO2, and ISO3 lookups; the following return the same response:

- [api / countries / 237 /](https://drf-demo-backend-production.herokuapp.com/api/countries/237)
- [api / countries / US /](https://drf-demo-backend-production.herokuapp.com/api/countries/US)
- [api / countries / USA /](https://drf-demo-backend-production.herokuapp.com/api/countries/USA)

The currency endpoint accepts ID and currency code lookups; the following return the same response:

- [api / currencies / 106 /](https://drf-demo-backend-production.herokuapp.com/api/currencies/106)
- [api / currencies / USD /](https://drf-demo-backend-production.herokuapp.com/api/currencies/USD)

### Sideloading

This project utilizes sideloading as opposed to nested serializers to present related data for the following reasons:

- Retains a flatter data structure more closely representing that of a row in an SQL database

- Reduces data duplication in cases where many objects share a relation thus reducing overall payload; a nested serializer will repeat data for every shared relation while a sideloaded relation need only appear once

- Allows the client to choose which sideloaded relations to fetch, if any, without affecting the underlying data structure of the default response

The following request will fetch all available cities and sideload their country foreign key relation:

- <a href="https://drf-demo-backend-production.herokuapp.com/api/cities/?include[]=country.*">api / cities / ? include[] = country.*</a>

The following request will fetch all available countries and sideload their capital and currency foreign key relations:

- <a href="https://drf-demo-backend-production.herokuapp.com/api/countries/?include[]=capital.*&include[]=currency.*">api / countries / ? include[] = capital.* & include[] = currency.*</a>

The following request will fetch all available currencies and sideload their country foreign key relation:

- <a href="https://drf-demo-backend-production.herokuapp.com/api/currencies/?include[]=country.*">api / currencies / ? include[] = country.*</a>

### Searching

Each endpoint in this project offers a general search or "autocomplete" feature that will perform a case-insensitive string search across one or multiple pre-defined fields.

In the case of the city endpoint, search will return results matching `City.name`:

- [api / cities / ? search = ous](https://drf-demo-backend-production.herokuapp.com/api/cities/?search=ous)

The country endpoint search will return results matching `Country.name` and `Country.name_native`:

- [api / cities / ? search = kor](https://drf-demo-backend-production.herokuapp.com/api/countries/?search=kor)
- [api / cities / ? search = 한](https://drf-demo-backend-production.herokuapp.com/api/countries/?search=한)

Finally, the currency endpoint search will return results matching `Currency.name`, `Currency.code`, `Currency.number`, and `Currency.country.name`:

- [api / currencies / ? search = dollar](https://drf-demo-backend-production.herokuapp.com/api/currencies/?search=dollar)
- [api / currencies / ? search = sd](https://drf-demo-backend-production.herokuapp.com/api/currencies/?search=sd)
- [api / currencies / ? search = 40](https://drf-demo-backend-production.herokuapp.com/api/currencies/?search=40)
- [api / currencies / ? search = united](https://drf-demo-backend-production.herokuapp.com/api/currencies/?search=united)





### Sorting

### Filtering


## Local Installation

### Repository

Clone this repository into a directory of your choosing:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/khunspoonzi/drf-demo.git
```

Navigate into the root directory of the newly cloned repository:

```console
$ cd drf-demo
```

### Environment

Rename `.env.example` to `.env` so that your environment variables are read into the Django settings module.

If you don't already have `Pipenv` installed in your machine, install it now:

```console
$ pip install --user pipenv
```

Initialize a `Pipenv` shell:

```console
$ pipenv shell
```

Install project dependencies:

```console
$ pipenv install
```

Assuming you have `USE_LOCAL_STORAGE` set to `True` in your `.env`, be sure to collect your static files locally:

```console
$ python manage.py collectstatic
```

### Database

If you haven't already installed Postgres on your machine, [do so now](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).

Create a Postgres database named `drf-demo`. On a Linux system, the following suffices:

```console
$ sudo -u postgres createdb "drf-demo"
```

Initialize your database tables and populate your database fixtures:

```console
$ python manage.py migrate
```

### Server

Run the local server:

```console
$ python manage.py runserver
```

If you wish to test background and scheduled tasks, be sure to [install Redis](https://redis.io/download) and start your server this way:

```console
$ heroku local
```

The above command will invoke your Celery worker and connect it to Redis in addition to starting your server.

### Django Admin

If you wish to log into and access the Django Admin panel, be sure to create a superuser first:

```console
$ python manage.py createsuperuser
```

You'll be able to log in via the `/admin/` route of your running server.
